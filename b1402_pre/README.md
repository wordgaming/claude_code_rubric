Guide to running the code:

Download the 'twitter_combined.txt.gz' file from this link:
https://snap.stanford.edu/data/ego-Twitter.html

Extract the 'twitter_combined.txt' file from the downloaded file into your Python environment.

Make sure the following libraries are installed on your environment:

networkx
matplotlib
random
os
numpy

Ensure the two script files are in the same directory as the 'twitter_combined.txt' file.

Then, use your Python runtime environment to run either script and wait for it to complete (it may take a few minutes).
